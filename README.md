This is the repository for the landing page of the University of Warwick Folk Society. The page can be viewed at https://warwickfolk.github.io/.

The landing page is hosted (for free :sunglasses:) on GitHub pages.

Any changes to the master branch while automatically trigger the website to be updated.

## Friendly note to future execs :wave:

Depending on your level of technical experience as an exec this could be a little scary, but don't worry it really is quite simple to add and update basic content on the website.

If you have a Computer Scientist or someone tech savvy on the exec see if they would be willing to take the role of Webmaster. It's a really simple site mostly in markdown powered by GitHub's Jekyll static site generator so it really isn't any harder than writing in Latex or Word. If there is no one don't worry, Most of the site is written in a combination of Markdown and HTML along with some yml config files.

HTML is a markup tool, it isn't really a programming language but rather a means of structuring a document. Like any document you may want to separate out content into a title and various sections and paragraphs. HTML allows you to to just that. Markdown should be even simpler. It just uses some tags to specify font and whatnot. You can find a basic Markdown guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Look at the `index.md ` file - this is where you'll find the main website content and hence be able to edit it. This is in Markdown, so it should be mostly intuitive.

You can always just contact someone from the previous exec and they'll be able to help ease the transition and help you get to grips with the website.

You can also contact Henry, who's not on the exec but was a professional software engineer and helps maintain this repository. If you can't find his contact details via git commit history, you can reach him by email through henryjia (at) protonmail.com

## For the tech savvy

This is a very simple site so there is no need to add any fancy CSS or JavaScript. The site is designed to be simple and easy to edit by anyone, regardless of technical ability. It is also future proof as we are not dependent on any external services like Google Sites or Wix and free of course, while still giving us more flexibility to do things our way. This is what the World Wide Web was designed for! Allowing people to share their passions and ideas for free and independently. Admittedly though, we do still depend on GitHub a bit though, but unless someone fancies running a server in their accommodation we can't really get around this.
